# Progress — 2026-09-08 (INSTRUCTION 46: shaped core, CFB headshots, Season Lab, ten UI fixes)

## Baseball — the core runs Josh's six $150 shapes and tilts on its own record
- `src/lib/core-shapes.ts`: his six examples verbatim, one per day in rotation; `lock-card.ts`
  seats one ticket per slot CAPPED at the slot's stake — Josh's same-day call: "Cap at Kelly,
  don't ride the full slot". What Kelly declines is retired (`slotUnderSum`), never re-bought.
- Self-calibration: trailing-30-day 2-leg vs 3+-leg ROI (≥ 20 graded each, ≥ 10-point gap)
  tilts the rotation toward the winning bucket; thinner records keep the full rotation.
- Grading passes now fire at Josh's five Pacific times — 8:00, 9:30, 12:00, 3:00, 4:45 —
  on the first ticker tick after each (INSTRUCTION 46b). No cron-job.org change: the existing
  window already covers them in PDT and PST. The fix round earlier caught a stranded-money
  double count that would have frozen legacy days at $0.
- Kelly sized off the legacy $750 default on the server (max $60/ticket, so $75/$90 slots
  could never fill). Paper bankroll is now $10,000 (Josh: "Bump the bankroll to $10,000"),
  seeded into the server engine; per-ticket ceiling $800, cap-at-Kelly rule unchanged.
- Games tab compact/collapsible, "Game Preview" with AVG/OPS + batter-vs-pitcher,
  Parlay Builder All/Away/Home filter, ledger tap-anywhere + player deep links.

## Football — headshot over own-team logo everywhere, phone Builder rebuilt, Season Lab
- ESPN byathlete headshot + teamId joined onto every prop row (gated to the game's two
  teams); `PlayerMark` replaces the two-logo `PairMark` on player picks.
- CFB Builder at 375px: money strip, stacked tickets, collapsed notes, sticky lock pill.
- `/season` Season Lab: typed season lines (no Odds API market exists), ESPN-projected
  fair numbers, ¼-Kelly on a $250 season bank, season parlays, own store.
- Parlay Calc left-aligned two-column from `lg`; Board overview collapsible.
GATE: tsc clean, 165 files / 2358 tests green after two pin fixes.
